# Automatic-Face-Mask-Dispensor-Machine (In-Progress)

This face mask dispensor machine totally made automatically and not worked when a person comes in front of it by wearning/not-wearing a mask. If the person is wearing a mask then the dispensor will show a greetings response to the person, else if the person is not wearing a mask the dispensor will automatically dispense a mask to the person with a message that the person wasn't wearning a mask and he must wear one to stop the spread of covid-19.

Me and my team were creating this project for robu.in's creato 2.0. 

My major role: I was given the task to make the full code of the automatic face amsk dispensor machine using opencv and python. Also i was responsible for integrating the raspberry pi and the code and the whole functing of the dispensor machine. 


Unqiue Selling Point: 

1. The whole machine is automatically operated. 
2. It automatically shows that the person is wearning a mask or not and gives message with respect to that. 
3. Can be helpfull in stopping the spread of covid-19. 


Challenges covered:

1. Faced a lot of difficulties while writing the face mask detection code. Did alot of research for this!! :)
2. The integration of raspberry pi and opencv was hectic. 



Tool used in this project: 

1. OpenCV library, for machine learning algorithms and training. 
2. Raspberry pi, for the major fucntioning of the face mask dispensor. 
3. Python and its various libraries like tensorflow, keras, numpy, matplotlib, etc. 
4. Jupter notebook IDE for code's testing, compilation and execution. 
5. Servo motors.
6. An open-belt drive system for the transfer of the mask. 


Learning Outcomes: 

1. Learned about OpenCV its various uses, libraries and many more.
2. Learned about python and its various machine learning oriented libraries such as keras, pandas, tensorflow, etc. 
3. Leanred about integration protocols between rapberry pi and opencv.
